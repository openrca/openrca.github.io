Telemetry hub. Automated root cause inference. Learn More   View on Github           What is OpenRCA? OpenRCA attempts to facilitate root cause inference of issues emerging in Kubernetes clusters. By constructing a real-time cluster topology graph enriched with telemetry data obtained from integrated telemetry sources (Prometheus, Elasticsearch, Falco, Istio, and others), provides operators with a powerful analytical toolkit for dealing with daily application failures, bottlenecks, and misconfigurations. Moreover, it comes with algorithms that leverage the collected graph data to pinpoint sources of complex cluster defects.       Read the full vision Comming soon!\n   Contributions welcome!
